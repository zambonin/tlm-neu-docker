Docker-related files that allow running an instance of Trusted List Manager
non-EU v5.0 [1] with reduced configuration effort. See "Trusted List Browser"
on [2] for more information on this software and the concepts behind TLs.

The containers run newer versions of the software stack in which tests were
made by the developers (cf. Section 2.1 of the manual [3]): Apache Tomcat
8.5 (under Java 8) and MySQL 5.7, both running on Debian "buster", and a Caddy
web server on Alpine for automatic HTTPS and pretty URLs.

Two versions of the software are supported: the original release and an
internationalized (i18n) version. They can be built via a command-line argument
as explained below; i18n is built by default.

It can be tested from a terminal as follows.

    $ docker volume create caddy_data
    $ docker-compose build --build-arg SOURCE=eu  # or SOURCE=i18n
    $ docker-compose up

A page should appear at http://localhost:80 -- login with user `test` and
password `password`. Please refer to the manual to use the application [3].
